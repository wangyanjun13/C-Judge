-- 性能监控和慢查询分析

-- 1. 查看当前活跃连接
SELECT 
    pid,
    usename,
    application_name,
    client_addr,
    state,
    query_start,
    state_change,
    query
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state = 'active' 
ORDER BY query_start;

-- 2. 查看慢查询统计
SELECT 
    query,
    calls,
    total_time,
    mean_time,
    rows,
    100.0 * shared_blks_hit / nullif(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0) AS hit_percent
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE mean_time > 100  -- 平均执行时间超过100ms的查询
ORDER BY mean_time DESC 
LIMIT 20;

-- 3. 查看表访问统计
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    seq_scan,
    seq_tup_read,
    idx_scan,
    idx_tup_fetch,
    n_tup_ins,
    n_tup_upd,
    n_tup_del
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
ORDER BY seq_scan DESC;

-- 4. 查看索引使用统计
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan,
    idx_tup_read,
    idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE idx_scan = 0  -- 未使用的索引
ORDER BY schemaname, tablename;

-- 5. 查看数据库大小
SELECT 
    pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database())) as database_size;

-- 6. 查看表大小
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as size
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;

-- 7. 查看锁等待情况
SELECT 
    blocked_locks.pid AS blocked_pid,
    blocked_activity.usename AS blocked_user,
    blocking_locks.pid AS blocking_pid,
    blocking_activity.usename AS blocking_user,
    blocked_activity.query AS blocked_statement,
    blocking_activity.query AS current_statement_in_blocking_process
FROM pg_catalog.pg_locks blocked_locks
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocked_activity ON blocked_activity.pid = blocked_locks.pid
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_locks blocking_locks 
    ON blocking_locks.locktype = blocked_locks.locktype
    AND blocking_locks.database IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.database
    AND blocking_locks.relation IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.relation
    AND blocking_locks.page IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.page
    AND blocking_locks.tuple IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.tuple
    AND blocking_locks.virtualxid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.virtualxid
    AND blocking_locks.transactionid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.transactionid
    AND blocking_locks.classid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.classid
    AND blocking_locks.objid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.objid
    AND blocking_locks.objsubid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.objsubid
    AND blocking_locks.pid != blocked_locks.pid
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocking_activity ON blocking_activity.pid = blocking_locks.pid
WHERE NOT blocked_locks.granted;
